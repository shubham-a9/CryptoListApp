# CryptoListApp

Requirements:
1. To complete the assignment, you must create at least 2 screens.
2. Screen One should have a welcome text and a navigation bar. It should redirect to the second
screen.
3. Screen Two should display a ListView/Table which shows real time price of more than 5
cryptocurrencies using an API. Feel free to choose any API which fetches live crypto prices.
4. Screen Two should have a button (like a star ⭐) next to each currency name to mark a
cryptocurrency as ’favorite’ which gets persisted in a database and displayed after clicking on a ‘favorites’ button.
(Note- It does not have to look pretty at all; the idea is to check your concepts on persistence using your choice of data storage. You could use Realm, CoreData or UserDefaults!)

Bonus: If you wish to, you can add a third screen which fetches latest tweets related to crypto (eg. All tweet with #btc). Feel free to use any external library/API of your choice.
